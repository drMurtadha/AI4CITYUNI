# Prompt ideas


## Music prompts

1. **A Shimmering Ocean at Midnight:** A dark, slow-moving ballad with layers of distant, crashing waves. It should feature soft, reverb-soaked guitars, delicate piano lines, and a deep, resonant bass to create a haunting, ethereal atmosphere.

2. **The Haunting of an Empty Forest:** An eerie, ambient track with hollow wind-like sounds and sporadic, deep drums. It should incorporate dissonant strings, crackling leaves, and faint whispers to evoke a feeling of isolation and mystery.

3. **Flickering Neon in the Rain:** A song with a moody, urban atmosphere, built on pulsating synths, muted drum beats, and a droning bassline. It should have distorted, glitchy sounds to create a dreamlike yet melancholic vibe.

4. **A Lost City Underwater:** A slow, ambient composition with rich, flowing synths and muffled, distant chimes. It should include deep, bubbling bass, underwater echoes, and shimmering high frequencies to evoke a submerged, forgotten world.

5. **Shadows Beneath the Moon:** A minimalist, nocturnal track with deep, resonant bass and sparse, delicate piano notes. The song should include soft pads and gentle arpeggios, creating a hypnotic and shadowy atmosphere.

6. **Waking from a Dream:** A soft, dreamy track featuring lush, ambient synths, slow, swelling bass, and distant, reverb-heavy guitar lines. It should evoke a sense of longing and reflection, with faint, barely-there percussion to add depth.

7. **The Pulse of an Alien Planet:** A mysterious, otherworldly soundscape built around irregular, pulsating beats, eerie synth pads, and deep, vibrating bass. The song should have strange, modulating sounds and echoing textures, giving a surreal, foreign feeling.

8. **A Fading Memory of Light:** A slow, melancholic track featuring soft piano chords, ambient strings, and a subtle, deep bass. It should create a feeling of nostalgia, with shimmering synths and soft, distant vocals, fading in and out.

9. **Dancing in the Shadows:** A hypnotic, dark track with slow, deep beats, airy pads, and whispering synths. The song should feel both mysterious and pulsing, with distant, echoing vocals and a haunting, looping melody.

10. **Voices in the Static:** An ambient track with glitchy, fragmented sounds, deep bass pulses, and soft, distant chimes. It should build a sense of unease and confusion, with whispering synths and irregular beats scattered throughout the composition.
